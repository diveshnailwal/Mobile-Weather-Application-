# Mobile-Weather-Application-
A React Native application that allows users to search for weather details by city, receive real-time temperature updates, toggle between light and dark mode, and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units. It also stores recently searched cities locally for quick access.

______x______
Features
Search Weather Details:

Fetches weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Real-Time Temperature Updates:

Displays live temperature updates from a WebSocket server.
Light and Dark Mode:

Automatically adapts to the device's system theme.
Light mode uses black text, while dark mode uses yellow text for enhanced visibility.
Celsius and Fahrenheit Toggle:

Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units dynamically.
Recently Searched Cities:

Stores the last 5 searched cities locally using AsyncStorage.
Allows quick access to previously searched cities.
Smooth Animations:

Weather details appear with a fade-in animation for a better user experience.

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('Client connected');
  setInterval(() => {
    const temperature = (Math.random() * 10 + 20).toFixed(2);
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ temperature }));
  }, 5000);
});

console.log('WebSocket server is running on ws://localhost:5000');

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
